AngularJS - you've seen it everywhere, but just what the heck is it?  What's so great about it?  Why would you choose to learn a whole new application framework when you already know and love jQuery (and/or KnockoutJS)?

In this discussion I'll walk you through the basics of AngularJS, from the very first lines of code you may write to those annoying gotchas that annoy everyone who starts out with the framework.  I'll show you how AngularJS can fundamentally change the way that you think about writing your rich client-side web applications.
